This project is a local document search engine built in C plus plus.
It supports keyword search and phrase search using positional inverted index.
The index is saved to disk so future searches do not require re indexing.
Fast startup is possible by loading docs meta inverted idx and positional idx.
Exact phrase search is useful for matching sequences like inverted index.
